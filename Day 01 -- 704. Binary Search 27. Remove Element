Thoughts:

If we set r = len(nums) - 1, then we need to use l<=r in the while loop: (both end inclusive)
    l,r = 0, len(nums) -1
    
    while l <= r:    
    mid = r - 1
    mid = l + 1

27. Remove Element
Link: 27. Remove Element

Thoughts:

Two Pointers: slow and fast pointer on index 0
if fast meets the removed element, then we directly jump to the next element
if fast does not meet the removed element, then we assign fast val to slow, move slow to next element
slow will be the number of element after reomving the target element
    s,f = 0,0
    if nums[f] != val:
        nums[s] = nums[f]
        s += 1
    f += 1
