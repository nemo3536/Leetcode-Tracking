## 704. Binary Search

**Link:** [704 Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)

**Thoughts:** 

 - If we set r = len(nums) - 1, then we need to use l<=r in the while loop: (both end inclusive)

```
    l,r = 0, len(nums) -1
    
    while l <= r:    
```  
```
    mid = r - 1
    mid = l + 1
```
       

**Time Complexity:**  O(logN)

**Spcae Complexity:**  O(1)


## 27. Remove Element

**Link:** [27. Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/)

**Thoughts:** 

 - Two Pointers: `slow`  and `fast` pointer on index 0
 - if `fast` meets the removed element, then we directly jump to the next element
 - if `fast` does not meet the removed element, then we assign `fast` val to `slow`, move `slow` to next element
 - `slow` will be the number of element after reomving the target element

```
    s,f = 0,0
```
```
    if nums[f] != val:
        nums[s] = nums[f]
        s += 1
    f += 1
```  
       

**Time Complexity:**  O(N)

**Spcae Complexity:**  O(1)
